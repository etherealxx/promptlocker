# promptlocker
Encrypt the prompt text inside a PNG file with password. For Windows (so far).

Check the executable on the Release section, ~~or just download [here](https://github.com/etherealxx/promptlocker/releases/download/v0.0.1-beta/promptlocker.exe)~~. Built with python. Compiled with [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/).

Apparently the executable got blocked by Google Chrome because it wasn't signed. Download [this](https://github.com/etherealxx/promptlocker/releases/download/v0.0.1-beta/promptlockertk.zip) instead (extract, run the dependencies installer, and run the batch file to run the python file).

Source code coming soon, until i figured out if the encryption mechanism is really secure.

Here's the module used
